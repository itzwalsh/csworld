# CS World

CS World is a personal project created with [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) inspired by two of my favorite sites, CSGONades + CSGOStats.

## What's the goal?

The goal of this project isn't to reinvent the wheel, but rather to practice my skills with NextJS and TypeScript to create something meaningful for me that I'll actually use.

## Questions / Concerns

If anything is broken or needs looked at, create an issue or if want to help, feel free to make a pull request! :)
